# MarkEight_Emoji_Interpretor
Created with CodeSandbox

It is a ReactJS application which works in two ways:

<li>Search Emojis from Library to see the meaning.</li>
<li> Click on emojis to see the meaning</li>

1) You can search the emoji from the predefined library of known emoji to find out their meaning. This method uses Dictonary to store emoji and meanings.
2) Click on the emoji to see its meaning, this method uses OnCLick hook of React.

Output from both the methods is displayed in the Output Box.
